        <h3>Frame from Shonee's video art piece "Last Species on Earth" (2022)</h3>
      <p>My goal with this exhibition is to bring together the individual practices of Shonee, myself, and the collaborative work of Clare Gatto and Kara Gut. Exploring the progressively interconnected relationship between real life and the digital world. I first found inspiration for this exhibit after visiting MOCAD and seeing the installations of Gatto and Gut. </p>
      <p>As a former “indoor kid” I find myself drawn to this topic because as I’ve grown out of my shell, real life has become increasingly centered around, and even reliant upon, digital forms of entertainment and communication. It used to be uncommon to use the internet. Using the internet as a source of news, entertainment, and as a social outlet was even more uncommon. Even a decade ago: leaving the house, there was less confusion about where people found their information or humor. Books, libraries, and schools were a main source of knowledge. Televisions and in-person events (movie showings, comedy shows, book clubs, etc.) were what American society relied upon for entertainment.</p>
      <p> Now, communication is largely shaped by what we consume on social media and on digital platforms. I also believe that our world views and impressions of the world are formed by what we see online. I can visualize cities I’ve never been to using digital tools like Google Earth. There’s also now a sea of people’s opinions and ideas about those cities to help inform my opinion. Despite this technology, my impression of those cities and locations is impacted by the restrictive nature of corporate media platforms. </p>
